3A Purposes of sentencing
The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows—
(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,

(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,

(c) to protect the community from the offender,

(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,

(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,

(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender,

(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.

 
Part 2–Penalties that may be imposed
 
Division 1–General
 
4 Penalties generally
(1) The penalty to be imposed for an offence is to be the penalty provided by or under this or any other Act or law.

(2) The penalty to be imposed for a statutory offence for which no penalty is so provided is imprisonment for 5 years.

(3) Part 3 applies to the imposition of all penalties imposed by a court, whether under this Act or otherwise.

 
4A Domestic violence offenders—requirement for full-time detention or supervision
(1) If a court finds a person guilty of a domestic violence offence, the court must impose on the person either—
(a) a sentence of full-time detention, or

(b) a supervised order.


(2) However, the court is not required to impose either of those sentencing options if the court is satisfied that a different sentencing option is more appropriate in the circumstances and gives reasons for reaching that view.

(3) For the purposes of this section, a "supervised order" is an order (being an intensive correction order, community correction order or conditional release order) that is subject to a supervision condition.

 
4B Domestic violence offenders—protection and safety of victims
(1) An intensive correction order must not be made in respect of—
(a) a sentence of imprisonment for a domestic violence offence, or

(b) an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 2 or more offences, any 1 or more of which is a domestic violence offence,

unless the sentencing court is satisfied that the victim of the domestic violence offence, and any person with whom the offender is likely to reside, will be adequately protected (whether by conditions of the intensive correction order or for some other reason).

(2) If the sentencing court finds a person guilty of a domestic violence offence, the court must not impose a home detention condition if the court reasonably believes that the offender will reside with the victim of the domestic violence offence.

(3) Before making a community correction order or conditional release order in respect of a person whom the sentencing court finds guilty of a domestic violence offence, the court must consider the safety of the victim of the offence.

 
Division 2–Custodial sentences
 
5 Penalties of imprisonment
(1) A court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.

(2) A court that sentences an offender to imprisonment for 6 months or less must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, its reasons for doing so, including—
(a) its reasons for deciding that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate, and

(b) its reasons for deciding not to make an order allowing the offender to participate in an intervention program or other program for treatment or rehabilitation (if the offender has not previously participated in such a program in respect of the offence for which the court is sentencing the offender).


(3) Subsection (2) does not limit any other requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.

(4) A sentence of imprisonment is not invalidated by a failure to comply with this section.

(5) Part 4 applies to all sentences of imprisonment, including any sentence the subject of an intensive correction order.

 
5A Compulsory drug treatment detention
The Drug Court may make an order under Part 2A of the Drug Court Act 1998 directing that an offender, who is an eligible convicted offender within the meaning of that Act, serve a sentence of imprisonment by way of compulsory drug treatment detention.
 
6 (Repealed)
 
7 Intensive correction orders
(1) A court that has sentenced an offender to imprisonment in respect of 1 or more offences may make an intensive correction order directing that the sentence or sentences be served by way of intensive correction in the community.

(2) If the court makes an intensive correction order directing that a sentence of imprisonment be served by way of intensive correction in the community, the court is not to set a non-parole period for the sentence.

(3) This section does not apply to an offender who is under the age of 18 years.

(4) This section is subject to the provisions of Part 5.

 [Note: Among other matters, Part 5 provides that a single offence cannot be the subject of an intensive correction order if the imprisonment imposed exceeds 2 years, and that multiple offences cannot be the subject of an intensive correction order or orders if the imprisonment imposed exceeds 3 years.]
 
Division 3–Non-custodial alternatives
 
8 Community correction orders
(1) Instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment on an offender, a court that has convicted a person of an offence may make a community correction order in relation to the offender.

(2) A community service work condition must not be imposed on a community correction order made in relation to an offender to whom the Children (Community Service Orders) Act 1987 applies.

(3) This section is subject to the provisions of Part 7.

 
9 Conditional release orders
(1) Instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment or a fine (or both) on an offender, a court that finds a person guilty of an offence may make a conditional release order discharging the offender, if—
(a) the court proceeds to conviction, or

(b) the court does not proceed to conviction but makes an order under section 10 (1) (b).


(2) In deciding whether to make a conditional release order with a conviction, the sentencing court is to have regard to the following factors—
(a) the person’s character, antecedents, age, health and mental condition,

(b) whether the offence is of a trivial nature,

(c) the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed,

(d) any other matter that the court thinks proper to consider.

 [Note: These factors are considered under section 10 in respect of an order under section 10 (1) (b) in connection with a conditional release order without a conviction.]

(3) To avoid doubt and without limitation—
(a) a fine and a conditional release order cannot be imposed in relation to the offender in respect of the same offence, and

(b) a conditional release order with a conviction may be made as an alternative to imposing a fine.


(4) This section is subject to the provisions of Part 8.

 
10 Dismissal of charges and conditional discharge of offender
(1) Without proceeding to conviction, a court that finds a person guilty of an offence may make any one of the following orders—
(a) an order directing that the relevant charge be dismissed,

(b) an order discharging the person under a conditional release order (in which case the court proceeds to make a conditional release order under section 9),

(c) an order discharging the person on condition that the person enter into an agreement to participate in an intervention program and to comply with any intervention plan arising out of the program.


(1A) A reference in any legislation (including this Act) to an order under this section includes, in the case of an order under subsection (1) (b), a reference to a conditional release order made under section 9 pursuant to that paragraph.

(2) An order referred to in subsection (1) (b) may be made if the court is satisfied—
(a) that it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment (other than nominal punishment) on the person, or

(b) that it is expedient to discharge the person under a conditional release order.


(2A) An order referred to in subsection (1) (c) may be made if the court is satisfied that it would reduce the likelihood of the person committing further offences by promoting the treatment or rehabilitation of the person.

(2B) Subsection (1) (c) is subject to Part 8C.

(3) In deciding whether to make an order referred to in subsection (1), the court is to have regard to the following factors—

(b) the trivial nature of the offence,

(c) the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed,

(d) any other matter that the court thinks proper to consider.

(c) for the purpose of enabling a court to give orders with respect to the restitution or delivery of property or the payment of money in connection with the restitution or delivery of property.

 [Note: Certain other Acts and regulations contain provisions to the effect that an order under this section made in respect of an offence is to be treated as a conviction for certain purposes of the legislation concerned. Accordingly, those provisions apply to an order under subsection (1) (b) in respect of the offence and a conditional release order made pursuant to that paragraph.]

(5) A person with respect to whom an order under this section is made has the same right to appeal on the ground that the person is not guilty of the offence as the person would have had if the person had been convicted of the offence.

 
10A Conviction with no other penalty
(1) A court that convicts an offender may dispose of the proceedings without imposing any other penalty.

(2) Any such action is taken, for the purposes of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, to be a sentence passed by the court on the conviction of the offender.

 [Note: The Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provide for appeals against sentence, including (in some circumstances) by the prosecutor.]
 
11 Deferral of sentencing for rehabilitation, participation in an intervention program or other purposes
(1) A court that finds a person guilty of an offence (whether or not it proceeds to conviction) may make an order adjourning proceedings against the offender to a specified date—

(b2) for the purpose of allowing the offender to participate in an intervention program, or

(c) for any other purpose the court considers appropriate in the circumstances.

(3) This section does not limit any power that a court has, apart from this section, to adjourn proceedings or to grant bail in relation to any period of adjournment.

(4) Subsection (1) (b1) and (b2) do not limit the kinds of purposes for which an order may be made under subsection (1), so that an order may be made under that subsection for the purpose of allowing an offender to participate in a program for treatment or rehabilitation that is not an intervention program, or to be assessed for participation in such a program.

21B Sentencing patterns and practices
(1) A court must sentence an offender in accordance with the sentencing patterns and practices at the time of sentencing.

(2) However, the standard non-parole period for an offence is the standard non-parole period, if any, that applied at the time the offence was committed, not at the time of sentencing.

(a) the offence is not a child sexual offence, and

22 Guilty plea to be taken into account for offences not dealt with on indictment
(1) In passing sentence for an offence on an offender who has pleaded guilty to the offence, a court must take into account—
(a) the fact that the offender has pleaded guilty, and

(b) when the offender pleaded guilty or indicated an intention to plead guilty, and

(c) the circumstances in which the offender indicated an intention to plead guilty,

and may accordingly impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise have imposed.

(1A) A lesser penalty imposed under this section must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.

(2) When passing sentence on such an offender, a court that does not impose a lesser penalty under this section must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, its reasons for not doing so.

(3) Subsection (2) does not limit any other requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.

(4) The failure of a court to comply with this section does not invalidate any sentence imposed by the court.

(5) This section applies only to a sentence for an offence that is dealt with summarily or to a sentence for an offence dealt with on indictment to which Division 1A does not apply. [Note: Discounts for the utilitarian value of a guilty plea to other offences are provided for by Division 1A.]

 
22A Power to reduce penalties for facilitating the administration of justice
(1) A court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender who was tried on indictment having regard to the degree to which the administration of justice has been facilitated by the defence (whether by disclosures made pre-trial or during the trial or otherwise).

25D Sentencing discounts for guilty plea for offences dealt with on indictment
(1) Mandatory nature of sentencing discount In determining the sentence for an offence, the court is to apply a sentencing discount for the utilitarian value of a guilty plea in accordance with this section if the offender pleaded guilty to the offence at any time before being sentenced.

(2) Amounts of sentencing discounts The discount for a guilty plea by an offender (other than an offender referred to in subsection (3) or (5) or section 25E) is as follows—
(a) a reduction of 25% in any sentence that would otherwise have been imposed, if the plea was accepted by the Magistrate in committal proceedings for the offence,

(b) a reduction of 10% in any sentence that would otherwise have been imposed, if the offender was committed for trial and the offender—
(i) pleaded guilty at least 14 days before the first day of the trial of the offender, or

(ii) complied with the pre-trial notice requirements and pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity able to be obtained by the offender,


(c) a reduction of 5% in any sentence that would otherwise have been imposed, if paragraph (a) or (b) does not apply.


(3) Discount variations—new count offences The discount for a guilty plea by an offender in respect of a new count offence is as follows—
(a) a reduction of 25% in any sentence that would otherwise have been imposed, if an offer to plead guilty was made by the offender and recorded in a negotiations document as soon as practicable after the ex officio indictment was filed or the indictment was amended to include the new count,

(a1) a reduction of 25% in any sentence that would otherwise have been imposed, if—
(i) the offender was discharged under section 68(2)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, and

(ii) an offer to plead guilty was made by the offender and recorded in a negotiations document as soon as practicable after the ex officio indictment was filed or the indictment was amended to include the new count,


(b) a reduction of 10% in any sentence that would otherwise have been imposed, if paragraph (a) or (a1) does not apply and the offender—
(i) pleaded guilty at least 14 days before the first day of the trial of the offender, or

(ii) complied with the pre-trial notice requirements and pleaded guilty to the offence at the first available opportunity able to be obtained by the offender,


(c) a reduction of 5% in any sentence that would otherwise have been imposed, if paragraph (a), (a1) or (b) does not apply.


(4) However, the discount in subsection (3) (a) does not apply if—
(a) the facts or evidence that establish the elements of the new count offence are substantially the same as those contained in the brief of evidence or other material served on the offender by the prosecutor in committal proceedings relating to the original indictment and the penalty for the new count offence is the same as, or less than, the offence set out in the original indictment, or

(b) the offender refused an offer to plead guilty to the new count offence that was made by the prosecutor in the committal proceedings relating to the original indictment and the offer was recorded in a negotiations document.


(5) Discount variations—person found fit to be tried after committal for trial The discount for a guilty plea by an offender who is found fit to be tried after the offender is committed for trial, and whose matter was not remitted to a Magistrate for continued committal proceedings, is as follows—
(a) a reduction of 25% in any sentence that would otherwise have been imposed, if the offender pleaded guilty as soon as practicable after the offender was found fit to be tried,

(b) a reduction of 10% in any sentence that would otherwise have been imposed, if paragraph (a) does not apply and the offender—
(i) pleaded guilty at least 14 days before the first day of the trial of the offender, or

(ii) complied with the pre-trial notice requirements and pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity able to be obtained by the offender,


(c) a reduction of 5% in any sentence that would otherwise have been imposed, if paragraph (a) or (b) does not apply.


(6) Opportunities for legal help to be taken into account For the purpose of determining under subsection (3) or (5) whether the offender pleaded guilty as soon as practicable after an ex officio indictment was filed or the original indictment was amended or after a finding of fitness to be tried, the court is to take into account whether the offender had a reasonable opportunity to obtain legal advice and give instructions to his or her legal representative (if any).

 
25E Sentencing discounts to apply in certain cases where guilty plea offer made for different offences and refused when made
(1) Discount where offer not accepted In determining the sentence for an offence, the court is to apply a sentencing discount in accordance with this section if—
(a) the offender made an offer recorded in a negotiations document to plead guilty to an offence, and

(b) that offence (the "different offence") was not the offence the subject of the proceedings when the offer was made, and

(c) the offer was not accepted by the prosecutor, and

(d) the offer was not subsequently withdrawn, and

(e) the offender was found guilty of the different offence or an offence that is reasonably equivalent to the different offence.

For the purposes of this subsection, an "offence is reasonably equivalent to a different offence" if—
(a) the facts of the offence are capable of constituting the different offence, and

(b) the maximum penalty for the offence is the same or less than the different offence.


(2) Discount where offer later accepted In determining the sentence for an offence, the court is to apply a sentencing discount for the utilitarian value of a guilty plea in accordance with this section if—
(a) the offender made an offer recorded in a negotiations document to plead guilty to an offence, and

(b) that offence (the "different offence") was not the offence the subject of the proceedings when the offer was made, and

(c) the offer was refused but accepted by the prosecutor after the offender was committed for trial, and

(d) the offender pleaded guilty to the different offence at the first available opportunity able to be obtained by the offender.


(3) Discount variation—offer to plead guilty to different offence The discount to be applied by the court is as follows—
(a) a reduction of 25% in any sentence that would otherwise have been imposed, if the offer was made before the offender was committed for trial,

(b) a reduction of 10% in any sentence that would otherwise have been imposed, if the offer was made after the offender was committed for trial and at least 14 days before the first day of the trial of the offender,

(c) a reduction of 5% in any sentence that would otherwise have been imposed, if the offer was made less than 14 days before or on or after the first day of the trial of the offender.


 
25F Other provisions applying to sentencing discount
(1) Application This section applies to a sentencing discount under this Division.

(2) Exception to application of discount—level of culpability The court may determine not to apply the sentencing discount, or to apply a reduced sentencing discount, if the court determines, on its own motion or on the application of the prosecution, that the discount should not be applied or should be reduced because the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can be met only by imposition of a penalty with no allowance for, or a reduction of, that discount.

(3) If a case conference certificate was filed in committal proceedings for the offence, a prosecutor is not entitled to apply to the court for a determination that the discount should not be applied or should be reduced unless the certificate records that the prosecutor notified the offender’s legal representative, at or before the conference, of the intention to make the application.

(4) Exception to application of discount—disputed facts The court may determine not to apply the sentencing discount, or to apply a reduced sentencing discount, if the court determines that the discount should not be applied or should be reduced because the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty has been eroded by a dispute as to facts that was not determined in favour of the offender.

(5) Offender to establish grounds for discount The burden of establishing that grounds exist for the sentencing discount lies on the offender and must be proved on the balance of probabilities.

(6) Application to Drug Court proceedings The sentencing discount applicable to a person who is sentenced for an offence under the Drug Court Act 1998 applies to a person who indicates an intention to plead guilty to an offence before being referred to the Drug Court, and who subsequently pleads guilty to the offence before the Drug Court, as if the person had pleaded guilty to the offence before being committed for sentence in committal proceedings for the offence.

(7) Discount information to be given to offender by court The court must indicate the following to the offender when passing sentence for an offence and must record the matters indicated—
(a) if the sentencing discount is applied, how the sentence imposed was calculated,

(b) if the court determines in accordance with this section not to apply or to reduce the discount, the reasons for the determination.


(8) Sentence not invalidated by failure to comply The failure by a court to comply with this Division does not invalidate any sentence imposed by the court.

(9) No discount where life sentence A sentencing court must not allow any discount under this Division for a guilty plea if the court determines a sentence of life imprisonment.

(a) reference may lawfully be made to, or evidence may lawfully be given of, the fact that the offender was found guilty or convicted of the principal offence, and

Part 4–Sentencing procedures for imprisonment
 
Division 1–Setting terms of imprisonment
 
44 Court to set non-parole period
(1) Unless imposing an aggregate sentence of imprisonment, when sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, the court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence).

(2) The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision).

(2A) Without affecting the requirement to set a non-parole period for a sentence, a court imposing an aggregate sentence of imprisonment in respect of 2 or more offences on an offender may set one non-parole period for all the offences to which the sentence relates after setting the term of the sentence.

(2B) The term of the sentence that will remain to be served after the non-parole period set for the aggregate sentence of imprisonment is served must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision).

(2C) The court need not indicate the non-parole period that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence unless it is required to do so by section 54B.

(3) The failure of a court to comply with subsection (2), (2B) or (2C) does not invalidate the sentence.

(4) Schedule 1 has effect in relation to existing life sentences referred to in that Schedule.

 
45 Court may decline to set non-parole period
(1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence or, in the case of an aggregate sentence of imprisonment, for offences, a court may decline to set a non-parole period for the offence or offences if it appears to the court that it is appropriate to do so—
(a) because of the nature of the offence to which the sentence, or of each of the offences to which an aggregate sentence relates, or the antecedent character of the offender, or

(b) because of any other penalty previously imposed on the offender, or

(c) for any other reason that the court considers sufficient.


(1A) A court may decline to set a non-parole period for a sentence of imprisonment, or an aggregate sentence of imprisonment, for an offence or offences set out in the Table to Division 1A of this Part only if the term of the sentence is at least as long as the term of the non-parole period that the court would have set for the sentence if a non-parole period had been set in accordance with that Division.

(1B) Subsection (1A) does not apply in relation to the sentencing of an offender in respect of an offence—
(a) which is being dealt with summarily, or

(b) if the offender was under the age of 18 years at the time the offence was committed.


(2) If a court declines to set a non-parole period for a sentence of imprisonment or an aggregate sentence of imprisonment, it must make a record of its reasons for doing so.

(3) Subsection (2) does not limit any other requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.

(4) The failure of a court to comply with the requirements of subsection (2) with respect to a sentence does not invalidate the sentence.

 
46 Court not to set non-parole period for sentence of 6 months or less
(1) A court may not set a non-parole period for a sentence of imprisonment if the term of the sentence is 6 months or less.

(2) For the avoidance of doubt, subsection (1) does not apply to a court imposing an aggregate sentence of imprisonment in respect of 2 or more offences for a term exceeding 6 months. This subsection has effect even if the sentence that would have been imposed for any of those offences would have been 6 months or less (as referred to in section 53A (2) (b)).

 
47 Commencement of sentence
(1) A sentence of imprisonment commences, subject to section 71 and to any direction under subsection (2), on the day on which the sentence is imposed.

(2) A court may direct that a sentence of imprisonment—
(a) is taken to have commenced on a day occurring before the day on which the sentence is imposed, or

(b) commences on a day occurring after the day on which the sentence is imposed, but only if the sentence is to be served consecutively (or partly concurrently and partly consecutively) with some other sentence of imprisonment.


(3) In deciding whether or not to make a direction under subsection (2) (a) with respect to a sentence of imprisonment, and in deciding the day on which the sentence is taken to have commenced, the court must take into account any time for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence or, in the case of an aggregate sentence of imprisonment, any of the offences to which the sentence relates.

(4) The day specified in a direction under subsection (2) (b) must not be later than the day following the earliest day on which it appears (on the basis of the information currently available to the court) that the offender—
(a) will become entitled to be released from custody, or

(b) will become eligible to be released on parole,

having regard to any other sentence of imprisonment to which the offender is subject.

(5) A direction under subsection (2) (b) may not be made in relation to a sentence of imprisonment (or an aggregate sentence of imprisonment) imposed on an offender who is serving some other sentence of imprisonment by way of full-time detention if—
(a) a non-parole period has been set for that other sentence, and

(b) the non-parole period for that other sentence has expired, and

(c) the offender is still in custody under that other sentence.


(6) A sentence of imprisonment (or an aggregate sentence of imprisonment) starts at the beginning of the day on which it commences or is taken to have commenced and ends at the end of the day on which it expires.

 
48 Information about release date
(1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, or to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 2 or more offences, a court must specify—
(a) the day on which the sentence commences or is taken to have commenced, and

(b) the earliest day on which it appears (on the basis of the information currently available to the court) that the offender will become entitled to be released from custody, or eligible to be released on parole, having regard to—
(i) that and any other sentence of imprisonment to which the offender is subject, and

(ii) the non-parole periods (if any) for that and any other sentence of imprisonment to which the offender is subject.


 [Note: Example No 1: A court sentences an offender to 7 days’ imprisonment. The sentence is imposed on a Monday. The court has not set a non-parole period. The offender is not subject to any other sentence of imprisonment. In this example, the court should specify that the sentence commences on the Monday on which it is imposed and that the earliest day on which the offender will become entitled to be released from custody is the following Sunday. Example No 2: A court sentences an offender to 12 months’ imprisonment. The sentence is imposed on 5 May 2000. The court has set a non-parole period of 9 months. The offender is not subject to any other sentence of imprisonment. Because the offender has been remanded in custody for sentencing since 27 April 2000, the court has backdated the commencement of the sentence to that date. In this example, the court should specify that the sentence is taken to have commenced on 27 April 2000 and that the earliest date on which the offender will become entitled to be released on parole is 26 January 2001. Example No 3: A court sentences an offender to 2 years’ imprisonment. The sentence is imposed on 3 June 2000. The court has set a non-parole period of 18 months. The offender is subject to one other sentence of imprisonment in respect of which the offender will become eligible to be released on parole on 21 September 2000. The court has directed that the new sentence is to run consecutively with the other sentence. In this example, the court should specify that the sentence commences on 22 September 2000 and that the earliest date on which the offender will become eligible to be released on parole is 21 March 2002.]

(2) The purpose of this section is to require a court to give information about the likely effect of a sentence.

(3) The failure of a court to comply with the requirements of this section with respect to a sentence does not invalidate the sentence.

 
49 Restriction on term of sentence
(1) The term of a sentence of imprisonment (other than an aggregate sentence of imprisonment)—
(a) must not be more than the maximum term of imprisonment that may be imposed for the offence, and

(b) must not be less than the shortest term of imprisonment (if any) that must be imposed for the offence.


(2) The term of an aggregate sentence of imprisonment—
(a) must not be more than the sum of the maximum periods of imprisonment that could have been imposed if separate sentences of imprisonment had been imposed in respect of each offence to which the sentence relates, and

(b) must not be less than the shortest term of imprisonment (if any) that must be imposed for any separate offence or, if the sentence relates to more than one such offence, must not be less than the shortest term of imprisonment that must be imposed for any of the offences.


 
50–51B (Repealed)
 
52 Court’s powers on appeal
(1) If an appeal is made against a conviction or sentence, the court determining the appeal—
(a) may vary or rescind any non-parole period set by the sentencing court, or

(b) may set a non-parole period for a sentence of imprisonment for which a non-parole period has not been set by the sentencing court.


(2) Any non-parole period that is varied or set under this section must comply with the requirements of this Division.

(3) This section does not limit any other power of a court in determining an appeal.

 
53 Multiple sentences of imprisonment
(1) When a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment on an offender in relation to more than one offence, the court must (unless imposing an aggregate sentence of imprisonment in accordance with section 53A) comply with the requirements of this Division by imposing a separate sentence in relation to each offence.

(2) The term, and any non-parole period, set under this Division in relation to a sentence of imprisonment is not revoked or varied by a later sentence of imprisonment that the same or some other court subsequently imposes in relation to another offence.

 
53A Aggregate sentences of imprisonment
(1) A court may, in sentencing an offender for more than one offence, impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to all or any 2 or more of those offences instead of imposing a separate sentence of imprisonment for each.

(2) A court that imposes an aggregate sentence of imprisonment under this section on an offender must indicate to the offender, and make a written record of, the following—
(a) the fact that an aggregate sentence is being imposed,

(b) the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence (after taking into account such matters as are relevant under Part 3 or any other provision of this Act) had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence.


(3) Subsection (2) does not limit any requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.

(4) The term, and any non-parole period, set under this Division in relation to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment is not revoked or varied by a later sentence of imprisonment that the same or some other court subsequently imposes in relation to another offence.

(5) An aggregate sentence of imprisonment is not invalidated by a failure to comply with this section.

 
53B Limitation on aggregate sentences imposed by Local Court
For the avoidance of doubt, the Local Court may impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment that does not exceed 5 years.
 
54 Exclusions from Division
This Division does not apply to the sentencing of an offender—
(a) to imprisonment for life or for any other indeterminate period, or

(b) to imprisonment under the Habitual Criminals Act 1957, or

(c) to detention under the Mental Health and Cognitive Impairment Forensic Provisions Act 2020.

 
Division 1A–Standard non-parole periods
 
54A What is the standard non-parole period?
(1) For the purposes of this Division, the standard non-parole period for an offence is the non-parole period set out opposite the offence in the Table to this Division.

(2) For the purposes of sentencing an offender, the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the Table to this Division that, taking into account only the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of that offence, is in the middle of the range of seriousness.

 
54B Consideration of standard non-parole period in sentencing
(1) This section applies when a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for an offence, or an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to one or more offences, set out in the Table to this Division.

(2) The standard non-parole period for an offence is a matter to be taken into account by a court in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender, without limiting the matters that are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender.

(3) The court must make a record of its reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period and must identify in the record of its reasons each factor that it took into account.

(4) When determining an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for one or more offences, the court is to indicate and make a written record of, for those offences to which a standard non-parole period applies, the non-parole period that it would have set for each such offence to which the aggregate sentence relates had it set a separate sentence of imprisonment for that offence.

(5) If the court indicates under subsection (4) that it would have set a non-parole period for an offence that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period for the offence, the court must make a record of the reasons why it would have done so and must identify in the record of its reasons each factor that it took into account.

(6) A requirement under this section for a court to make a record of reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than a standard non-parole period does not require the court to identify the extent to which the seriousness of the offence for which the non-parole period is set differs from that of an offence to which the standard non-parole period is referable.

(7) The failure of a court to comply with this section does not invalidate the sentence.

 
54C Court to give reasons if non-custodial sentence imposed
(1) If the court imposes a non-custodial sentence for an offence set out in the Table to this Division, the court must make a record of its reasons for doing so. The court must identify in the record of its reasons each mitigating factor that it took into account.

(2) The failure of a court to comply with this section does not invalidate the sentence.

(3) In this section—  "non-custodial sentence" means a sentence referred to in Division 3 of Part 2 or a fine.

 
54D Exclusions from Division
(1) This Division does not apply to the sentencing of an offender—
(a) to imprisonment for life or for any other indeterminate period, or

(b) to detention under the Mental Health and Cognitive Impairment Forensic Provisions Act 2020.


(2) This Division does not apply if the offence for which the offender is sentenced is dealt with summarily.

(3) This Division does not apply to the sentencing of an offender in respect of an offence if the offender was under the age of 18 years at the time the offence was committed.

(c) the sentence proposed to be imposed for the offence is or includes a term of imprisonment, and

(d) the court is of the opinion that it is not appropriate to impose an ordinary sentence on the offender because the information presently available does not permit a satisfactory assessment of whether the offender has or is likely to develop a serious personality or psychiatric disorder, or a serious cognitive impairment, such that the court cannot satisfactorily assess either or both of the following matters—
(i) whether the offender is likely to re-offend,

(ii) the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation.

(2) The other Divisions of this Part apply in respect of a provisional sentence in the same way as they apply in respect of an ordinary sentence.

(3) A provisional sentence is not a sentence for an indeterminate period, for the purposes of Division 1, merely because it is subject to review and redetermination under this Division.

 
60E Progress reviews
(1) A court that imposes a provisional sentence on an offender is to review the offender’s case from time to time for the purpose of deciding whether it is appropriate to impose a final sentence.

(2) A court imposes a final sentence by—
(a) setting aside the provisional sentence and substituting instead another sentence as the final sentence for the offender, or

(b) confirming the provisional sentence as the final sentence for the offender.


(3) If the court sets aside the provisional sentence—
(a) the term of imprisonment imposed under the final sentence is not to exceed the term of imprisonment imposed under the provisional sentence, and

(b) the non-parole period (if any) set for the final sentence is not to exceed the non-parole period set for the provisional sentence, and

(c) the final sentence imposed is taken to have commenced on the day on which the provisional sentence commenced.


(4) Subject to this Division, this Part applies to a final sentence in the same way as it applies to an ordinary sentence.

(5) A final sentence is not subject to review and redetermination under this Division.

(6) A decision to decline to impose a final sentence on an offender is not a sentence and, accordingly, is not subject to appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

(7) A court that conducts a further progress review after having declined to impose a final sentence on an offender is to conduct that review as a fresh hearing in relation to the question of whether it is appropriate to impose a final sentence on the offender.

 
60H Time limit for imposition of final sentence
(1) A final sentence must be imposed on an offender who is the subject of a provisional sentence before the expiry of the initial custodial period.

(2) The "expiry of the initial custodial period" is—
(a) the date that is 5 years after the date the provisional sentence is imposed, or

(b) the date that is one year before the date the non-parole period (if any) for the provisional sentence ends,

whichever happens first.

(3) A final sentence is not invalid merely because it is imposed after the expiry of the initial custodial period.

 
60I Appeals
(1) On appeal against a provisional sentence, a court hearing the appeal that has power to vary the provisional sentence and substitute a new sentence (however expressed) may—
(a) substitute a new provisional sentence, or

(b) substitute a final sentence.


(2) If a provisional sentence is varied and a new provisional sentence is imposed by a court on appeal—
(a) the functions of the court under this Division with respect to progress reviews and the imposition of a final sentence on the offender are to be exercised by the court that first imposed a provisional sentence on the offender, and not the appeal court, and

(b) a reference in this Division to the date on which the sentence is imposed is a reference to the date on which a provisional sentence for the relevant offence was first imposed (and not the date a new provisional sentence was imposed by the appeal court), and

(c) a reference in this Division to a term of imprisonment imposed, or non-parole period set, under a provisional sentence is a reference to a term of imprisonment imposed, or non-parole period set, under the new provisional sentence as imposed by the appeal court.


(3) To avoid doubt, a court that imposes a provisional sentence that is varied on appeal can set aside the provisional sentence (as varied on appeal) under section 60G and substitute another sentence as the final sentence for the offender in accordance with this Division.

 [Note: Appeals against provisional sentences can be made to the Court of Criminal Appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. If the Court of Criminal Appeal varies the provisional sentence, the original sentencing court (and not the Court of Criminal Appeal) must conduct progress reviews and impose a final sentence. The final sentence can also be appealed under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.]
 
Division 3–Miscellaneous
 
61 Mandatory life sentences for certain offences
(1) A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.

(2) A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of a serious heroin or cocaine trafficking offence if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence and the court is also satisfied that—
(a) the offence involved—
(i) a high degree of planning and organisation, and

(ii) the use of other people acting at the direction of the person convicted of the offence in the commission of the offence, and


(b) the person was solely or principally responsible for planning, organising and financing the offence, and

(1A) Despite subsection (1), a member of the offender’s close family may be specified in a non-association order if, and only if, the court considers that exceptional circumstances exist because there is reasonable cause to believe, having regard to the ongoing nature and pattern of criminal activity in which the member and the offender have both participated, that there is risk that the offender may be involved in conduct that could involve the commission of a further offence of the kind to which section 17A applies if the offender associates with that member.

(2) The places or districts specified in a place restriction order as places or districts that the offender must not frequent or visit may not include—

(2A) Despite subsection (2), a place or district referred to in that subsection may be specified in a place restriction order if, and only if, the court considers that exceptional circumstances exist because there is reasonable cause to believe, having regard to the ongoing nature and pattern of participation of the offender in criminal activity occurring at that place or district, that there is risk that the offender may be involved in conduct that could involve the commission of a further offence of the kind to which section 17A applies if the offender frequents or visits that place or district.

(2B) The court must make a record of its reasons for making an order under subsection (1A) or (2A).

(2C) The failure of a court to comply with subsection (2B) does not invalidate the order.

(b) the offender’s parents, step-parents and grandparents, and

(c) the offender’s children, step-children and grandchildren, and

(a) the offender’s obligations under the order, and

(b) the consequences that may follow if the offender fails to comply with those obligations.


(2) A non-association order or place restriction order is not invalidated by a failure to comply with this section.

 
100C Commencement of non-association and place restriction orders
A non-association order or place restriction order commences—
(a) on the date on which it is made, or

(b) if it is stayed as a consequence of appeal proceedings but confirmed on appeal, whether expressly or impliedly, on the date on which it is confirmed.

 
100D Suspension of non-association and place restriction orders while offenders in custody
(1) An offender’s non-association order or place restriction order is suspended—

(a) the offender did so in compliance with an order of a court, or

(b) having associated with the specified person unintentionally, the offender immediately terminated the association.


(3) Without limiting subsection (1), it is a reasonable excuse for frequenting or visiting a specified place or district in contravention of a place restriction order if the offender did so in compliance with an order of a court.

 
100F Variation or revocation of non-association and place restriction orders following subsequent conviction
(1) This section applies to an offender who is sentenced in respect of an offence (the "new offence") while subject to a non-association order or place restriction order in respect of some other offence (the "old offence").

(2) When sentencing the offender for the new offence, the court may vary or revoke the non-association order or place restriction order for the old offence, regardless of whether the order was made by it or by some other court.

 
100G Variation or revocation of non-association and place restriction orders on application
