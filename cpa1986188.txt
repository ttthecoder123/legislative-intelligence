the court may order a separate trial of any count or counts of the indictment.

(3) Subsection (1) does not apply if a court is satisfied—
(a) there is a significant possibility that a jury will rely on an act or omission as being essential to its reasoning in reaching a finding of guilt, and

(b) evidence of the act or omission has been adduced as tendency evidence or coincidence evidence.


 
162 Alternative verdict of attempt on trial for any indictable offence

(b) an assault with intent to commit the offence,

it may acquit the person of the offence charged and find the person guilty of the attempt or assault, and the person is liable to punishment accordingly.

Division 4–Costs
 
211 Definition
In this Part—
  "professional costs" means costs (other than court costs) relating to professional expenses and disbursements (including witnesses’ expenses) in respect of proceedings before a court.
 
211A Imposition of court costs levy
(1) An accused person who is convicted of an offence in summary proceedings before a court is, by virtue of the conviction, liable to pay a "court costs levy" "" that is of the amount prescribed by the regulations.

(2) However, a court costs levy is not payable in relation to any of the following—
(a) a conviction resulting in the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment (unless the execution of the sentence is suspended by the court),

(b) an order under section 10 (1) (a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in relation to an offence that is not punishable by imprisonment,

(c) a finding of guilt in relation to a traffic offence (within the meaning of section 210 of this Act) by the Local Court when dealing with the accused person under Division 4 of Part 3 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987,

(d) a conviction in proceedings before the Drug Court,

(e) a conviction that the regulations exempt from liability to pay the levy.


(3) A convicted person who is under the age of 18 years is not liable to pay the court costs levy if the court directs that the person is exempt from liability to pay the levy in respect of the conviction. Such a direction may be made when the court convicts the person, or at any time afterwards.

(4) The court costs levy is in addition to, and does not form part of, any pecuniary penalty imposed in respect of the offence.

(5) The court costs levy is to be paid to the registrar of the court. The registrar is to pay the levy to the prosecutor if court costs have been paid by the prosecutor in respect of the proceedings.

(6) The commencement of any proceedings by way of appeal against, or review of, a conviction in respect of which the court costs levy has been imposed on a person stays the liability of the person to pay the levy. In such a case—

(b) the dismissal of any such proceedings removes the stay of liability.


(7) To avoid doubt, this section extends to—
(a) proceedings conducted in the absence of the accused person, and

Section 42A of that Act provides for the Children’s Court to make orders regarding court costs at its discretion.] [Note: Section 4 of the Fines Act 1996 provides that a court costs levy payable under this section is, for the purposes of that Act, taken to be a fine imposed by the court that convicted the person or found the person guilty.]

(3) Without limiting the operation of subsection (1), a court may order that the prosecutor in summary proceedings pay professional costs if the matter is dismissed because—

(b) the matter is withdrawn or the proceedings are for any reason invalid.


(4) (Repealed)


(5) The order must specify the amount of professional costs payable.

 
214 Limit on award of professional costs to accused person against prosecutor acting in public capacity

(c) that the prosecutor unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate properly) any relevant matter of which it was aware or ought reasonably to have been aware and which suggested either that the accused person might not be guilty or that, for any other reason, the proceedings should not have been brought,

(d) that, because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor, it is just and reasonable to award professional costs.


(2) This section does not apply to the awarding of costs against a prosecutor acting in a private capacity.

(3) A person who, under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1979, is an appointed officer employed by an approved charitable organisation is taken not to be acting in a private capacity if the officer acts as the prosecutor in any proceedings under that Act or section 9 (1) of the Veterinary Practice Act 2003.

Division 1–Evidence in certain sexual offence proceedings
 
Subdivision 1–Preliminary
 
290 Application
(1) This Division applies to proceedings in respect of a prescribed sexual offence, including committal proceedings.

(2) This Division applies to proceedings in which a person stands charged with a prescribed sexual offence, whether the person stands charged with that offence alone or together with any other offence (as an alternative or additional count) and whether or not the person is liable, on the charge, to be found guilty of any other offence.

 
290A Definitions
(1) In this Division—  "accused person", in relation to any proceedings, means the person who stands, or any of the persons who stand, charged in those proceedings with a prescribed sexual offence.  "complainant", in relation to any proceedings, means the person, or any of the persons, against whom a prescribed sexual offence with which the accused person stands charged is alleged to have been committed.

(2) In this Division, a reference to a person against whom a prescribed sexual offence is alleged to have been committed includes—
(a) in relation to an offence under section 80E of the Crimes Act 1900, a reference to the person who is alleged to have been the subject of sexual servitude, and

(b) in relation to an offence under section 91D, 91E or 91F of the Crimes Act 1900, a reference to the person under the age of 18 years who is alleged to have participated in an act of child prostitution, and

Subdivision 2–In camera proceedings
 
291 Proceedings must be held in camera when complainant gives evidence
(1) Any part of any proceedings in respect of a prescribed sexual offence in which evidence is given by a complainant, or an audio visual or audio recording of evidence of the complainant is heard by the court, is to be held in camera, unless the court otherwise directs.

(2) This section applies even if the complainant gives evidence by means of closed-circuit television or other technology or under any alternative arrangements available to the complainant under section 289V or 294B or under Part 6.

(3) The court may direct that the part of proceedings in which evidence is given by the complainant be held in open court only at the request of a party to the proceedings and only if the court is satisfied that—
(a) special reasons in the interests of justice require the part of the proceedings to be held in open court, or

(b) the complainant consents to giving his or her evidence in open court.


(4) The principle that proceedings for an offence should generally be open or public in nature, or that justice should be seen to be done, does not of itself constitute special reasons in the interests of justice requiring the part of the proceedings to be held in open court.

(5) If the court directs that the part of the proceedings in which evidence is given by the complainant be held in open court, that does not affect the entitlement of the complainant to give evidence in the manner provided for by section 289V or 294B or by Part 6.

(6) If the proceedings are proceedings in which a record of the original evidence of the complainant is tendered by the prosecutor under Division 3, this section does not require the record to be tendered in camera.

(7) This section does not affect the entitlement of a complainant to have a person or persons present when giving evidence under section 294C.

 
291A Other parts of proceedings may be heard in camera
(1) The court may direct that any other part of any proceedings in respect of a prescribed sexual offence, or the entire proceedings, be held in camera.

(2) The court may make a direction under this section on its own motion or at the request of any party to the proceedings.

(3) In determining whether to make a direction under this section, the court is to consider the following matters—
(a) the need of the complainant to have any person excluded from those proceedings,

(b) the need of the complainant to have any person present in those proceedings,

(c) the interests of justice,

(d) any other matter that the court thinks relevant.


(4) The requirement under section 291 that any part of the proceedings in which evidence is given by a complainant be held in camera unless the court otherwise directs still applies whether or not a direction is made under this section.

(5) If the court makes a direction under this section, it may (either absolutely or subject to conditions) exempt any person from that direction to the extent necessary to allow that person to be present as a support for a person giving evidence or for any other purpose that the court thinks fit.

(6) This section does not affect—
(a) the entitlement of a complainant to have a person or persons present when giving evidence under section 294C, or

(b) the entitlement of a vulnerable person to have a person present when giving evidence under section 306ZK.


 
291B Incest offence proceedings to be held entirely in camera
(1) Any proceedings in respect of an offence under section 78A or 78B of the Crimes Act 1900 are to be held entirely in camera, despite any other provision of this Division.

(2) The court may (either absolutely or subject to conditions) exempt any person from the requirement that the proceedings be held in camera to the extent necessary to allow that person to be present as a support for a person giving evidence or for any other purpose that the court thinks fit.

(3) This section does not affect—
(a) the entitlement of a complainant to have a person or persons present when giving evidence under section 294C, or

(b) the entitlement of a vulnerable person to have a person present when giving evidence under section 306ZK.


 
291C Media access to proceedings held in camera
(1) If a complainant gives evidence in proceedings in respect of a prescribed sexual offence from a place other than the courtroom by means of closed-circuit television facilities or other technology that enables communication between that place and the courtroom (whether under section 289V or 294B or Part 6), and the proceedings, or the part of the proceedings concerned, are held in camera under this Division, a media representative may, unless the court otherwise directs, enter or remain in the courtroom while the evidence is given from that other place. This subsection does not apply to proceedings in respect of an offence under section 78A or 78B of the Crimes Act 1900.

(2) The fact that proceedings in respect of a prescribed sexual offence, or any part of such proceedings, are held in camera under this Division does not prevent the court from making such arrangements as the court considers reasonably practicable to allow media representatives to view or hear the evidence while it is given, or to view or hear a record of that evidence, as long as the media representatives are not present in the courtroom or other place where the evidence is given during the in camera proceedings. [Note: For example, the court may permit media representatives to view the proceedings from a place other than the courtroom by means of closed-circuit television facilities.]

(3) In this section—  "media representative", in relation to any proceedings, means a person engaged in preparing a report of the proceedings for dissemination through a public news medium.

(a) wore particular clothing or had a particular appearance, or

293A Direction may be given by Judge if differences in complainant’s account
(1) This section applies if, on the trial of a person for a prescribed sexual offence, the Judge, after hearing submissions from the prosecution and the accused person, considers that there is evidence that suggests a difference in the complainant’s account that may be relevant to the complainant’s truthfulness or reliability.

(2) In circumstances to which this section applies, the Judge may direct the jury—
(a) that experience shows—
(i) people may not remember all the details of a sexual offence or may not describe a sexual offence in the same way each time, and

(b) delay by that person in making any such complaint.


(2) In circumstances to which this section applies, the Judge—

(c) must not direct the jury that delay in complaining is relevant to the victim’s credibility unless there is sufficient evidence to justify such a direction.

(4) An accused person is not entitled to object to the suitability of the person or persons chosen by a complainant to be with the complainant when giving evidence, and the court is not to disallow the complainant’s choice of person or persons on its own motion, unless the complainant’s choice is likely to prejudice the accused person’s right to a fair trial (for example, because the person chosen by the complainant is a witness or potential witness in the proceedings).

(5) During any part of the proceedings in which the complainant gives evidence, the person or persons chosen by the complainant to be present when the complainant gives evidence are taken to be exempt from any requirement or direction under this Division that requires the proceedings, or the part of the proceedings concerned, to be held in camera.

294CA Admission of evidence of sexual offence witness given as complainant in earlier proceedings
(1) This section applies if a person who was a complainant in proceedings for a prescribed sexual offence (the "earlier proceedings") is called as a sexual offence witness in later proceedings for a prescribed sexual offence (the "current proceedings").

(2) A prosecutor may tender as evidence in current proceedings a record of the evidence of the person given in the earlier proceedings (the "original evidence").

(3) The original evidence of the person means all evidence given by the person in the earlier proceedings, including the evidence given by the person on examination in chief in the earlier proceedings and any further evidence given on cross-examination or re-examination in those proceedings.

(4) Despite anything to the contrary in the Evidence Act 1995, or any other Act or law, a record of the original evidence of the person is admissible in the current proceedings if—

(b) the effect of editing any inadmissible evidence from the original evidence,

(c) the availability or willingness of the person to attend to give further evidence and to clarify any matters relating to the original evidence,

(d) the interests of justice,

(e) any other matter the court thinks relevant.


(9) If the court allows a record of the original evidence of the person to be admitted, the court may give directions requiring the record to be altered or edited for the purpose of removing any statements that would not be admissible if the original evidence of the person had been given orally before the court hearing the current proceedings in accordance with the usual rules and practice of the court.

(10) The hearsay rule (within the meaning of the Evidence Act 1995) does not prevent the admission of a record of the original evidence of the person under this section or the use of that record to prove the existence of a fact that the person intended to assert by a representation made in the original evidence.

(11) Sections 306E–306G (including any regulations made for the purposes of those sections) apply for the purposes of this section with such modifications as are necessary.

(5) A witness must not be asked—
(a) to give evidence that is inadmissible under subsection (2) or (3), or

(b) by or on behalf of the accused person, to give evidence that is or may be admissible under subsection (4) unless the court has previously decided that the evidence would, if given, be admissible.

(ii) had taken part in, or not taken part in, sexual activity of a general or specified nature, and


(b) the accused person might be unfairly prejudiced if the complainant could not be cross-examined by or on behalf of the accused person in relation to the disclosure or implication,

the complainant may be so cross-examined, but only in relation to the experience or activity of the nature (if any) so specified during the period (if any) so specified.

(5) If the court makes such an order, the sexual offence witness is taken to be a complainant for the purposes of section 578A of the Crimes Act 1900 and that section applies accordingly. [Note: Section 578A of the Crimes Act 1900 prohibits the publication of any matter which identifies the complainant in prescribed sexual offence proceedings or any matter which is likely to lead to the identification of the complainant.]

(6) A witness is to be treated as a sexual offence witness, even if the witness has not yet given evidence in the proceedings, if the court is satisfied that the prosecutor has given notice to the accused person that the prosecutor intends to adduce evidence that the accused person committed an offence or act referred to in subsection (2) (a) or (b) against the witness.

(b) delay by that person in making a complaint.


(2) The Judge—
(a) must warn the jury that absence of complaint or delay in complaining does not necessarily indicate that the allegation that the offence was committed is false, and

(b) must inform the jury that there may be good reasons why a victim of domestic violence may hesitate in making, or may refrain from making, a complaint about a domestic violence offence, and

(c) must not warn the jury that delay in making a complaint is relevant to the victim’s credibility unless there is sufficient evidence to justify the warning.


(3) If the trial of the person also relates to a prescribed sexual offence alleged to have been committed by the person against the same victim, the Judge may—
(a) also give a warning under section 294, or
